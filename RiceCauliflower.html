<p>So recipe no.2 for my high protein, low calorie recipes is this Fried Rice with Cauliflower meal~

    Notice that I did not say “cauliflower fried rice” — that's because I do not believe in completely eliminating actual rice! Let's just say I'm Asian and I do not believe that cauliflower can be a substitute for rice – I mean, come on, rice is life! However, I still think cauliflower would make a fantastic addition to fried rice, to really add a ton of volume to your meal but also add those fantastic nutrients. Also, I added in some tofu for extra protein — YUM!</p>
